        <h1>Day Theme</h1>
        <p>The theme of
        the day depends on the context, as it can refer to a specific productivity method
        , an individual day's theme, or a national holiday. Today's themes include National Chicken Fried Steak Day,
        National Financial Crime Fighter Day, National Microneedling Day, National Mule Day, and National Pumpkin
        Day.
        In a more abstract sense, a daily theme can be related to a productivity method called "day theming" which
        involves
        batching similar tasks together, or a philosophical theme centered on focusing on the present day.

        <h2>Night theme</h2>
        <p>A night theme, also known as dark mode or dark theme, is a display setting that uses a dark background with light-colored text,
             icons, and user interface elements. This setting is designed to reduce eye strain, 
             improve readability in low-light conditions, and save battery power on devices with OLED screens.
              It is a user preference available on many operating systems, apps, and websites. </p>
